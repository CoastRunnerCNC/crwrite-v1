The Arduino driver is required to connect to the CNC mill.  CRWrite should automatically install this driver, but you may need to manually install it if the mill isn't showing up in CRWrite.  To install, click install.bat, which will add the core driver components required to operate the cnc mill.

A restart may be required before the CNC will appear in CRWrite.
